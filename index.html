<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

Hi, my name is Tâm Le Minh. I am currently a master student in applied mathematics for life science at the 
University of Paris-Saclay. My main interest lies in the applications of mathematics in ecology and biology. 
I am also interested in the interfaces with computer science such as machine learning and optimization problems. 
Before, I have worked 2 years as a software engineer at Thales Alenia Space Deutschland. Before, I have studied 
aeronautical engineering at ISAE-SUPAERO and aviation psychology at Cranfield University. I am using this website 
to share about my favourite projects. You can check them out in the Projects section. I hope you enjoy them!
